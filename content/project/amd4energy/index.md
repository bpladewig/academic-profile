AMD4Energy is a collaborative project funded by the KIT Excellence Initiative. Over 24 months, we will design and build a materials development framework that greatly accelerates the process of materials discovery.

Specifically, we aim to prepare two new materials synthesis and testing systems;
- photochemical homogeneous CO2 conversion, and
- electrochemical hetergeneous CO2 conversion.

The two project leaders are Dr. Nicole Jung, who is head of the photochemical catalysis, and Dr. Bradley Ladewig, who is heading up the electrochemical conversion.
